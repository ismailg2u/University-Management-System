# Java Back-End Project (Minimal Spring Boot Usage)
## Description

This is a Java back-end project created using Spring Boot Initializer. However, the goal of the project is to demonstrate how a back-end system can be built with minimal reliance on Spring Boot features. The project mainly focuses on using standard Java development principles, with Spring Boot serving primarily for dependency management and project setup.

The project includes basic functionality for handling HTTP requests, and it communicates with the Postman app to test API endpoints.

## Features
